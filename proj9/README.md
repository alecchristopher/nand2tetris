#### Sand Simulator
Simulates sand falling and pilling up. 

#### How to Run. 
Using the VMEmulator provided by the Nand2Tetris Tools, select the entire "sandSim" directory as an input. After program starts, move the source of sand using the left and right arrow keys. 

#### Notes
Becuase the program is clearing the screen every frame, and redrawing all sand particles, after a little bit of execution the program screen will start to flicker. 

#### The sand acts on the following rule set
1. Fill the space below if it is open OR
2. Fill the space below and to the left if it is open OR
3. Fill the space below and to the right if it is open
